   <h2>History of Chandrayaan Mission</h2>
   <p>India launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata_(satellite)" target="_main">Aryabhatta</a> satellite on April 19,1975, which marked India's entry into space era. It was named after famous Indian mathematician Aryabhatta.Nearly four decades since the inception of ISRO, it focused on the missions that benefits India in some way such as self-reliant, launch capabilities, societal need etc.
    In April 2003 over 100 eminent Indian scientists approved a recommendation to launch an Indian probe to moon. On 15 Aug 2003 then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced Chandrayaan project from red Fort in his Independence Day speech.

    <h3>The Chandrayaan-1</h3>
    <p> The historic day on 22 October 2008 Chandrayaan-1 was launched. It was designed to study the Moon's surface and mineral composition, map the distribution of elements and minerals, and search for water-ice in the polar regions of the Moon. One of the most significant achievements of Chandrayaan-1 was the discovery of water molecules on the lunar surface. Since then India achieved bigger milestones in the space exploration.</p>
    <h3>The Chandrayaan-2</h3>
    <p>11 years later after the succes of Chandrayaan-1, another lunar mission named Chandrayaan-2 was launched. This mission consisted of three components: an orbiter, a lander named Vikaram and a rover named Pragyan. The lander Vikram carried the rover Pragyan and was programmed to perform soft landing near the Moon's south pole. However, during the final stages of descent, communication with the laner lost, and it crashed on the lunar-surface on September 6, 2019. Despite the unsuccessful landing, the orbiter continued to function as intended and provided valuable data. The Chandrayaan-2 represents India's commitment to space exploration particularly in the field of lunar studies. Despite the failed landing, the mission contributed valuable insight to our understanding of the Moon and its suface.</p>
    <h3>The Chandrayaan-3</h3>
    <p>After the failure of landing mission of Chandrayaan-2, India planned to launch a successor lunar mission, Chandrayaan-3. This mission was launched on 14 July 2023. It reached the Moon on 20 Auguts 2023 and successfully soft-landed on the lunar surface on 20 August 2023. The soft-landing took place on south pole of the Moon and with this <i>India became 4th nation to soft-land a spacecraft on moon and 1st country to soft-land in southern pole.</i> Similar to Chandrayaan-2 this mission also consisted a rover named Pragyan.</p>
